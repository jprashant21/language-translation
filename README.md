# language-translation


Translation, or more formally, machine translation, is one of the most popular tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that deals with translating from one language to another. In the early days, translation is initially done by simply substituting words in one language to words in another. However, doing that does not yield good results since languages are fundamentally different so a higher level of understanding (e.g. phrases/sentences) is needed. With the advent of deep learning, modern software now adopts statistical and neural techniques, which are proven to be more effective when doing translation.
